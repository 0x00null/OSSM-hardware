# OSSM - Open Source Sex Machine
OSSM (pronounced like "Awesome") is a user friendly every day sex machine for the people.

This project aims to help people curious about sex machines explore their interest. A second objective is optionally learning how mechanics, electronics, physics and computing are involved in youe sexual pleasure.

### Primary design goals:
- Compact
- Quiet
- Low cost
- 3D printable
- Easily sourced components
- Doesn't look like a giant machine

## Getting Started
There are a few hardware flavours to choose from, we've included user modified versions in case that fits your use case better!

### Eagle PCB
Simple PCB to power an ESP32 (wifi enabled microcontroller) from 24V and breakout the pins for the OSSM control

### Mechanical design
The OSSM use a compact belt design with components that have become widely available due to 3D printing popularity.
It is driven by a Nema23 motor of **your** choosing, although we reccomend small integrated closed loop steppers for their cost to performance ratio.

### Wiring Notes

This should be a good start for the wiring of your OSSM, however depending on your hardware mix settings or wiring may be different.

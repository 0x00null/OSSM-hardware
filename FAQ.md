### Q: What is OSSM? 

A: An OSSM is compact sex machine that can be customised to suit you.  Based around a NEMA24 pattern for electric motors it can be driven by stepper or best of all servo motors it uses a combination of 3D printed and off the shelf parts. 

### Q: Why go to all this trouble?  Why don't you just buy a ready made machine? 

A: The OSSM is open you are not tied to a specific company and it does a lot more than equivalently priced machines.  Best of all you can fully control the stroke speed and most importantly depth.  You can make patterns or even your own control software.  Maybe you want to add a stroker rather than a dildo, you can modifiy it to do that.  Not enough power? You can use a bigger motor up to a certain point. 

### Q: What parts do I need? 

A: Head over to <URL> 
  
### Q: I've been reading about motors and now I'm really confused
  
A: While you can theoretically use any Nema24 mount motor.  There are motors that work and some that work better.  Stepper motors are cheaper and noiser so the community recommends closed loop servo motors.  These are more efficient and more importantly easier to program.  

### Q:  What strength of  motor do I need? 
  
A: That depends on a couple of factors.  
- Vaginal or Anal use
- Size of toys
- Anticipated Speed
  
We don't have a lot of recorded data [Please help us with this!] however the general suggeestions are;
- **100w or 140w** IHSV57 Servo : Vaginal usage with small / medium size toys and Anal usage with smaller toys 
- **180w** IHSV57 servo works with a wide range of toys but if you like big really heavy fantasy dildos you might want to consider building a Squooter [see the discord] that uses and even a larger motor mount; the NEMA34 which has even more powerful motors.

A build with a servo motor will have a flat torque curve across the speed range. That's to say - it will push just as hard at the slow speeds as well as the fast. 
  With a stepper, the most force will be at the slower speeds and the top speed of a stepper is much less than the servo we've chosen to work with. 
  

### Q: Hold on, why does anal play need more powerful motors? 
A: When many people orgasm they clench their ass. This clench is powerful enough to stop less powerful motors that are moving heavier dildos.  

### Q: What sized 3D printer do I need? 
A: The minimum bed size is 105mm x 105mm for the largest single piece. Approximately 125mm of height is required for the shorter vac-u-lock compatible adapter, the plate is significantly shorter. 

### Q: What print material is best?
A: All of our testing has been with simple PLA, however if you do print it in an interesting material make sure to share it to the discord!

  
### Q: What is the infill percentage? 
A: 40% has been found to work just fine with PLA

### Q: How do I mount toys onto the OSSM? 
A: Aside from the motor this is second decision.  There is a vacc-u-lock compatible mount <insert name> and a plate mount for suction cup toys that has some points to tie a dildo down <insert name> 

  
### Q: What to I mount the machine on?  
A: Well there are a few designs available.  THere are standard pipe mounts for US/Canadian along with 80/20 rails that can be used like a construction set.  There are even manfrotto boom compatible adaptors.  It is really limited by you imagination. 

  
### Q: How do I control my OSSM 
A: It depends on how you are going to use it.  Basic OSSM control is via a web page there are also hardware controller.  If you want something specific you can create your own that is the great thing about open source hardware.

### Q: Did you just say "control via a web page?"  Can I get people to control my OSSM over the internet?
A: Yes you can control an OSSM over the internet.  Isn't it a great time to be alive and kinky.  

### Q: There is an OSSM reference board do I have to buy it to make an OSSM? 
A: No you don't but it does make building an OSSM a lot easier and stops you having to solder anything.  

### Q: Powersupplies what size do I need?
A: That is linked to the size of motor.  The higher the wattage of motor the higher amperage of powersupply you need.  All supplies have to output 48v ideally they are double insulated.  
- 100w JMC we currently suggest a 6A 24V Supply
- 140w /180w JMC we currently suggest a 12A 24V Supply
